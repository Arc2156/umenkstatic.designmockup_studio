        A lava lamp is a decorative lamp, invented in 1963 by british entrepreneur edward craven walker, the founder of the lighting company mathmos.it consists of a bolus of a special coloured wax mixture inside a glass vessel, the remainder of which contains clear or translucent liquid. The only lava lamp suitable for children is the mathmos neo.the neo was designed with children in mind, so as well as looking stylish it is also shatterproof, has fixture points, doesn’t get too hot, and is screwed together as a secure unit. Your lava lamp&#039;s flow may not be as lively as that of another lava lamp, but that does not necessarily make it defective or in need of repair.
