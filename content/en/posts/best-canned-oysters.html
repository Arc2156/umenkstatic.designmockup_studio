        I will be trying with fresh oysters in the future. If your store doesn’t have a robust seafood section and there isn’t a seafood market close by, scope out the canned meat aisle close to the canned tuna. They can be (carefully) eaten raw, fried, smoked, baked, broiled, grilled, and more.

    <h3>I had canned oysters and creamed corn that were expiring and so looked this up in order to use them.</h3>
    <p>I also added carrots, cauliflower and celery, used 2% milk, and used coconut oil and butter for the roux. There, i can always find one or two brands of fresh, whole shucked oysters. They can be (carefully) eaten raw, fried, smoked, baked, broiled, grilled, and more. This liquid adds delicious, briny, rich flavor to the broth.</p>
