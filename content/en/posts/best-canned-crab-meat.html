    <p><strong>Best Canned Crab Meat</strong>. I’ve had several people tell me this cold crab dip is the best they’ve tried — i think you’ll like it as well. Pollock fish, hearts of palm, jackfruit, artichoke hearts and lion’s mane mushroom are a few healthy, whole food ingredients that you can easily use in place of imitation crab to bump up the nutritional profile.</p>

        Do not overfill with too much filling. Crab meat and sugar should never be in the same recipe. I did add about 1 clove garlic and some minced onion maybe 1 tablespoon.

    <h3>There are five grades of picked crabmeat.</h3>
    <p>Maryland, chesapeake bay, and baltimore come to mind when thinking of crab cakes. Since the crab is the star of the show here, i only recommend using fresh jumbo lump crab meat. Jumbo lump crab in a simple seafood recipe with a crunchy topping and simple imperial sauce. It’s easy to create fresh, delicious homemade flavor with simple ingredients.</p>
