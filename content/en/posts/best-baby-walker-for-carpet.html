        The other walker that i was considering was the joovy spoon walker but the reason why i chose this was because of the height setting. A carpet is a textile floor covering typically consisting of an upper layer of pile attached to a backing. This walker rolls very well on both floor and carpet.

    <h3>The pile was traditionally made from wool, but since the 20th century, synthetic fibers such as polypropylene, nylon or polyester are often used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool.</h3>
