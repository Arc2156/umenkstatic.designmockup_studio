        Wall hung and pedestal sinks are the most commonly used types of bathroom sinks. These are easy to install — literally place it in a hole cut into the bathroom counter — and offer defined lines between the sink and counter. A small bathroom typically will have a vanity that is 18, 24, or 30 inches long.
    </p>
    <h3>The depth of the vanity is also an issue.</h3>
    <p>Inset basins are fully recessed into a housing unit. Shop for high quality kitchen &amp; bathroom fixtures, a copper bathtub or a farmhouse sink. Shop for a beautiful stone farmhouse sink for a stunning kitchen. The depth of the vanity is also an issue.</p>
