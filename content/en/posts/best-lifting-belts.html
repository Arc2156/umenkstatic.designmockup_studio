        Manually lifting a patient can put a strain on the back of carers as they can possibly injure themselves in the process of lifting patients up. A column with no settings can be used as a spacer. Due to the amount of stress that weightlifting belts withstand on a daily basis, reinforced stitching is the best way to ensure that a belt will last over the long run.
